# 75percentage


75percentage is a web app that keeps track of all your school/college/university/whatever attendance information at one place. You might be a college/university student and it might get troublesome on your behalf to keep track of which classes you did and which you didn't and in the course of time, you may be in the pressure of getting 75% plus attendance or they'll not allow you into the exam. Sometimes some teachers even forget their attendance sheets or they cancel the attendance for the day due to some issues like massbunks or proxies. 75percentage helps you out by keeping track of all the classes that were in your routine and those you attended indicating clearly your attendance percentage metric. 75percentage removes the burden of all teachers and allows you to handle your attendance individually.

## How to use?
  Just at the night, see your time table and click on tabled button for what all subjects you have. 
  After coming from college, just click on the attended button for all the classes you have attended.
  Sit back and relax. 75percentage manages your database and shows you your attendance just with 5 minutes of user dedicated     time.

## Future Scope:
  Add the option to enter timetable and display it on the user dashboard to help the user experience process.
  Enable more metrics like whatever classes  are to be attended in the following week for a subject and how to achieve your goal.
